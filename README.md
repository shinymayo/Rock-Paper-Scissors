# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is my first "from scratch" JavaScript project. 

The aim is to create a simple rock/paper/scissors game, played against a computer, within the console. So no major styling will be used in the initial project. 

Step 1: to make function that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’; this function in the game to make the computer’s play.

Step 2: to make function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).

Step 3: to make NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
